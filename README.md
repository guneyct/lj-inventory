## General Changes

- Item duplication gaps that can be made through bugs have been closed.
- Arrangements were made in the warehouse / luggage / glove box / market sections.
- Drops in a box prop when you drop items on the ground. You can get it by interacting with Target, or you can interact with it by opening the inventory normally.

## Updated Section

- The Generate part has been completely added and its problems have been fixed. (Many professions, including civilians, have special crafting items.)
- When you want to give the item, it is no longer given directly, and thanks to a small menu opened in the inventory, the section opens where you can see the people you want to give the item to.
- In the Give section, if the giver/given wears a mask, it shows as Anonymous for the sake of meta-gaming. ()
